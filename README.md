# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger.
It is one of the famous competitions on kaggle.
The Model Predicts Whether A Passenger Would Survive On The Titanic Taking Into Account And Comparing And Finding Relations Amongst Various Features.
First of we import the required libraries.
Then we do analyzation and visualization of the data.
Next we do feature selection.
Finally we build our Model using different Machine Learning Algorithms.
The model which gives the maximum accuracy will be preffered. 
the project is depended on:
Python3.
Numpy.
Pandas.
Matplotlib.
Supervised Learning.
Machine Learning Algorithm.
Classification Algorithms.
For data Analysis we use : Supervised Machine learning Techniques: + Logic Regression Model + Plotting results + Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels + Basic Random Forest + Plotting results.
Hope You Find it useful!!!
